                <div class="col1">
                    <p>Grooming your dog is a healthy activity that prevents skin irritations and
                        infections that are caused by trapped moisture underneath a tangled or matted coat.
                       Grooming your dog is as essential as you having a spa session once in a while.
                       Having dog is always joyful, yet we sometimes forget that they do need
                        to look and feel fabulous, grooming also helps keep your home clean!
                       Dogs as our pets, are the only one that loves more than himself 
                       so why not appreciate them for being such a lovely friend<br></p>
